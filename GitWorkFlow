A general flow:
1. Check out a branch that is named for the feature
2. Do all of your work, including adding tests
3. Run all the tests
4. git add/stash and commit all you changes.
5. git co master
6. pull origin master
7. git co [branch]
8. git merge master
9. resolve any merge conflicts by going to the file **If you didn't write it, make sure and pull over other humans to discuss the conflict **
10. Run all of the tests again
11. git push origin [branch]
12. Make a pull request
13. Flag Adam to review the pull request before/after the next standup
14. before working during each work period, pull origin master and merge with branch
