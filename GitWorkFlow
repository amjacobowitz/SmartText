A general flow:
1. git add/stash and commit all you changes.
2. git co master
3. pull origin master
4. git co [branch]
5. git merge master
6. resolve any merge conflicts by going to the file **If you didn't write it, make sure and pull over other humans to discuss the conflict **
7. git push origin [branch]
8. Make a pull request
9. Flag Adam to review the pull request before/after the next standup
10. before working during each work period, pull origin master and merge with branch
