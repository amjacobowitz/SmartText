#Contributing
This is an open-source project that has the potential to be a game-changer
in classrooms across the country. It does, however, have some steps before
it is classroom ready. Specifically, the sockets need to be made ready
for individual classrooms, authentication needs to be increase for privacy
of student data, and the data that is collected over time needs to be
made available and accesible to teachers.
